# RAIF Architecture

This document outlines the initial directory structure and goals of the
RAIF runtime. The system is intended to provide CPU/GPU/NPU optimized
kernels with automatic dispatch based on hardware capabilities.

Currently only a minimal set of CPU operations are provided as a proof
of concept.
